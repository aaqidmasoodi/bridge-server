                <h2>Language Support</h2>
                
                <h3>What languages does Bridge Chat support?</h3>
                <p>We currently support 20+ languages including English, Arabic, Urdu, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Finnish, Danish, Norwegian, and Czech. More languages are coming soon!</p>
                
                <h3>How accurate is the translation?</h3>
                <p>We use advanced AI translation models that provide highly accurate translations for most common phrases and sentences. For best results, use clear, grammatically correct sentences and avoid slang or highly colloquial language.</p>
                
                <h3>Can I translate between any two languages?</h3>
                <p>Yes, as long as both languages are supported by Bridge Chat. When you create a room, you select both your language and your partner's language, and the system handles translation between those two languages.</p>
                
                <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
                
                <h3>Is my conversation private?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely. Bridge Chat is designed with privacy as a core principle. Conversations are temporary and automatically deleted when the chat ends. We don't store chat history or personal information.</p>
                
                <h3>Do you store my messages?</h3>
                <p>No. All messages exist only in active memory during your chat session and are permanently deleted when the chat ends or expires. We have no message archives or databases of conversations.</p>
                
                <h3>Can other people see my chats?</h3>
                <p>No. Each chat room is private and accessible only through the unique link you receive. Only the two participants can access the chat room.</p>
                
                <h2>Technical Questions</h2>
                
                <h3>How long do chat rooms last?</h3>
                <p>Chat rooms are temporary:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If only one person joins, the room expires after 5 minutes</li>
                    <li>Once both participants join, the room remains active until both leave</li>
                    <li>Rooms are automatically deleted when inactive</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What happens if I close my browser?</h3>
                <p>If you close your browser or lose connection, your chat partner will see a notification that you've left. The room will remain active for your partner, who can continue waiting for you to return or end the chat.</p>
                
                <h3>Do I need special software or apps?</h3>
                <p>No special software is required. Bridge Chat works directly in your web browser on desktop and mobile devices. No app downloads or installations needed.</p>
                
                <h3>Does it work on mobile devices?</h3>
                <p>Yes, Bridge Chat is fully responsive and works on smartphones and tablets. You can access it through any modern mobile browser.</p>
                
                <h2>Usage Scenarios</h2>
                
                <h3>How can I use Bridge Chat to talk to someone who speaks Arabic?</h3>
                <p>When creating your chat room:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select "English" as your language</li>
                    <li>Select "Arabic" as your partner's language</li>
                    <li>Create the room and share the link with your Arabic-speaking contact</li>
                    <li>When they join, type in English and see both your English messages and Arabic translations</li>
                    <li>Your partner types in Arabic and sees both Arabic messages and English translations</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Can I use this for language learning?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Bridge Chat is excellent for language practice. You can chat with native speakers, see your messages in both languages, and practice real conversations with instant feedback through translation.</p>
                
                <h3>Is this good for business communication?</h3>
                <p>Yes, many professionals use Bridge Chat for quick international communication. It's perfect for initial client meetings, quick questions, or informal business discussions where you need to overcome language barriers.</p>
                
                <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
                
                <h3>What if the translation seems wrong?</h3>
                <p>Translation accuracy can vary with complex sentences, slang, or cultural references. Try rephrasing your message more simply, or break long messages into shorter sentences for better translation accuracy.</p>
                
                <h3>Why can't I find my chat room?</h3>
                <p>Chat rooms expire after 5 minutes if only one person joins. Make sure you're sharing the exact link with your partner, and both of you should join within the 5-minute window.</p>
                
                <h3>The chat isn't loading. What should I do?</h3>
                <p>Try these steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refresh the page</li>
                    <li>Clear your browser cache</li>
                    <li>Try a different browser</li>
                    <li>Check your internet connection</li>
                    <li>Disable browser extensions that might block the service</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
                
                <h3>Can I save my conversations?</h3>
                <p>Bridge Chat doesn't provide conversation saving features, as all chats are temporary by design. If you need to save a conversation, you can copy and paste the text manually during your chat.</p>
                
                <h3>Will you add more languages?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we're continuously working to expand language support. We prioritize languages based on user demand, so let us know which languages you'd like to see added!</p>
                
                <h3>How can I provide feedback or report issues?</h3>
                <p>We'd love to hear from you! You can contact us at feedback@bridgechat.app with any suggestions, feedback, or technical issues you encounter.</p>
                
                <h3>Is there a mobile app?</h3>
                <p>Currently, Bridge Chat works directly in your mobile browser with full mobile optimization. We're considering native apps for popular platforms based on user demand.</p>
